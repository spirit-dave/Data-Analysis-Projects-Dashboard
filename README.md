# Data Analysis: Gender Disparities Accross Graduate Fields
This repository provides a data analysis pipeline to examine gender representation across various fields of study using a graduate dataset. It identifies the top 5 fields with the largest gender disparities and visualizes these findings through charts. Additionally, it explores potential factors contributing to these disparities and suggests strategies for bridging the gaps.

## Features
1. Data Loading and Preparation: Reads a graduate dataset from an Excel file and processes the data for analysis.
2. Gender Distribution Analysis: Calculates the percentage representation of males and females in each field of study.
3. Gender Disparity Identification:
- Identifies fields with the largest gender disparities.
- Saves the top 5 fields to an Excel file.
4. Visualizations:
- Bar chart for top 5 fields with the largest gender disparities.
- Line chart showing gender disparities across all fields.
- Pie charts illustrating gender distribution in each field.
5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Highlights the top 5 fields with the largest gender disparities.
- Examines factors contributing to these disparities.
- Proposes actionable strategies to address the imbalances.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Top 5 Fields with the Largest Gender Disparities

The analysis identifies the fields with the largest differences between male and female representation. These fields are visualized in:

- Excel File: Top_5_Disparities.xlsx

2. Significant Contributing Factors

- Societal Norms: Traditional roles and stereotypes influencing career choices.

- Educational Opportunities: Accessibility to resources and mentorship in underrepresented fields.

- Cultural Biases: Institutional biases affecting enrollment and career encouragement.

3. Potential Strategies for Bridging Disparities

- Promote STEM Outreach: Encourage underrepresented genders in STEM fields through scholarships and mentorship programs.

- Policy Changes: Implement gender quotas or incentives for educational institutions.

- Awareness Campaigns: Challenge stereotypes through community and media efforts.

- Supportive Environments: Create inclusive environments that empower individuals to pursue non-traditional fields.
